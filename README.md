# React JS Practice Repository

## Introduction

Welcome to the **React JS Practice Repository**! This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of various React.js projects and experiments. It is designed to demonstrate different concepts, patterns, and capabilities of the React library, ranging from basic component structures to more complex state management and UI implementations.

Whether you are exploring specific features like Hooks and Event Handling or looking for reference implementations for common UI patterns like Data Tables and Dashboards, this repository provides a structured set of examples.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into individual folders, each containing a standalone React application or a specific concept demonstration. Below is an overview of the projects included:

### 1. Counter Application
*   **Location**: `/Counter`
*   **Description**: A fundamental React application demonstrating state management using the `useState` hook. It features increment, decrement, and reset functionality, serving as a perfect starting point for understanding React's reactivity.

### 2. Customer Feedback
*   **Location**: `/Customer-Feedback`
*   **Description**: A feedback collection tool that demonstrates form handling, input validation, and managing user submissions within a React environment.

### 3. Data Table
*   **Location**: `/Data Table`
*   **Description**: An implementation of a data grid or table component. This project explores rendering lists of data, and typically includes features such as sorting, filtering, and pagination.

### 4. Employee Panel
*   **Location**: `/Employee-Panel`
*   **Description**: An administrative dashboard or panel for managing employee data. This project covers more complex UI layouts, CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and component composition.

### 5. Event Handler
*   **Location**: `/Event-Handler`
*   **Description**: A focused project demonstrating how to handle various DOM events in React. It covers synthetic events, event propagation, and passing handlers as props.

#### More projects are being progressively integrated into the repository.
